Inertia Java FX Game - Multithreading Extension


Inertia is a puzzle game, originally implemented by Ben Olmstead. The objective of this game is to collect all gems 
without running into mines, with the added twist that you will not stop once you start moving until you hit either a 
wall, a "stop cell", a mine, or the border of the game board.

An online demo of the game can be found [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/inertia.html).

JavaFX is used to build the user interface and Java is used to handle the gaming logic
